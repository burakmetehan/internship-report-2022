\section{Introduction}

I have done my first summer practice at OBSS as a software engineer intern for 30 working days between the dates mentioned above. Since the intern program of the OBSS is remote and my department accepts remote practices, I have done the practice online/remotely.

I had an informative practice, and I have learned a lot in Java and web development. My practice included two parts: knowledge sharing and developing a project. In the first part, knowledge about Java and web development were shared while in the second part, I focused developing a project with the knowledge I had acquired the early weeks in the practice.

In this report, I will express what I have learned and my experiences in the practice at OBSS.
