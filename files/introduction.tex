\section{Introduction}

I have done my first summer practice at OBSS as a software engineer intern for 30 working days between the above dates. Since the intern programs of the OBSS are remote and my department accepts remote practices, I have done the practice online/remotely.

I had an informative internship and learned a lot in Java and web development. My internship included two parts: knowledge sharing and developing a project. In the first part, knowledge about Java and web development were shared, while in the second part, I focused on developing a project with the knowledge I had acquired in the early weeks in practice.

In this report, I will express what I have learned and my experiences in practice at OBSS.
