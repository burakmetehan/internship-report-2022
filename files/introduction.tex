\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

I have done my first summer practice at OBSS as a software engineer intern for 30 working days between the above dates. Since the intern programs of the OBSS are remote, and my department accepts remote practices, I have done the practice online/remotely.

I had an informative internship and learned much about Java and web development. After learning the basics of Java, Web Development, Spring, and React, our mentor asked us to develop a middle-scaled example project. Since my internship included lots of learning, my report contains two main parts: knowledge sharing and developing a project.

Due to the structure of my internship, I will mention what I learned in the knowledge-sharing part until the \hyperref[final-project]{\underline{Final Project}} section, and then move into the main project.
