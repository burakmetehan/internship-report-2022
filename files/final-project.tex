\section{Final Project}

In this part of the report, I will explain the project I developed in details. I will divide the project into two parts: Back-end and Front-end.

For the final project, we were given some time to develop. The first time we were given time to develop was after Spring framework part. It was for the developing the back-end. The second time given was after the React part. React part was finished on second day of the fourth week. Since main internship program was four weeks at OBSS, we were expected to finish the final project until the end of the fourth week. However, I could not complete the project in this time. Since my internship period was six weeks and I could not complete the project, they asked me to complete the project within this period.

In the fifth week of my internship, I decided to start from scratch as I thought that I made mistakes at many points while developing the project and that if I continued to develop on these mistakes, it would harm the development phase. First, I tried to find out where I lacked and where I made mistakes.

I tried to learn React from the beginning for 3 days because I thought I had problems in the React part. As a result of this work, I have come to a position where I can do many things on React without difficulty. I spent the next 2 days thinking about simple things and design. In my last week, I rebuilt and coded the entire project, starting from scratch.

\subsection{Project and Requirements}

Final project was a basic Book Portal whose requirements were provided. We were provided the document in the \hyperref[book-portal]{attachments} for basic requirements.

In my project, there are two main entities: User and Book. Each user has a role, admin or user role, and book lists for favorite and read books. Each book has several information about it: name, author, type, publisher, publication date. Both admins and users can log in to the system. Each admin is also an user and is able to do everything an users can do such as updating passwords, seeing books, adding books to their read or favorite lists, searching a book and its informaiton. Additionally, an admin can add, update, and delete both users and books.
