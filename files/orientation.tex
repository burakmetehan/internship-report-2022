\section{Orientation}

On the first day of my internship, the company introduced itself by 1-hour orientation. The orientation provided general information about the company and internship programs. Information about management systems, personal data protection law (KVKK), and occupational health and safety (OHS) are also given.

After the orientation, I met with my team. Firstly, our mentor introduced himself, and then everyone did so. The general internship schedule was shared, and our responsibilities in our internship were stated. Our primary responsibility was to attend the programs/classes on time.
