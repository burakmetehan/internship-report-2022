\section{Conclusion}

This summer practice was my first practice and the first experience in Java dn web development. The first part of my internship consisted of knowledge sharing. That part taught me so much about Java, Web Development, Spring. This knowledge sharing was quite intense and sometimes hard to follow, and the last part of it was not beneficial for me due to the intensity. I had hard times about React and I had to spend time and efforts to learn and straighten the information that I misunderstood. I believe information sharing part may be planned better by spreading the program for at least one week more, five weeks at total.

The second part of the practice consisted of developing a project from scratch. The project part was pretty beneficial because before this project, I was trying to do something exactly that needed to be done in my projects and homework at school, and I was trying to fix bugs if it happened. Although I did not have much difficulty in my previous experiences, I had a lot of difficulty in this project because I did not have time constraints or too much time in the projects and assignments I have done so far, and I have not dealt with such a comprehensive project before.

Although the requirements were given in the project, we were asked to think and develop many things such as thinking the design of the general flow. Until the end of the fourth week (last week of the normal internship program), we were asked to finish this project. Due to my limited time, I did not have time to think much, so I started developing it after a short thought process. This short-term thinking and inexperience made my job very difficult. I couldn't complete the project in the expected time due to the long time I wasted on unfocused parts such as design.

In short, I tried to do everything in the best way and move on to the next stage, instead of revealing something tangible on a part and then continuing to develop on it. But I realized too late that this wouldn't work in this type of development. Therefore, I was not able to finish my project at the end of the fourth week. However, I managed to finish my project with decent planning and developing until the end of the my internship.

In conclusion, in addition to many things I learned about Java and web development, I learned how not to develop a project from scratch and possible mistakes in a four-week period. In the last two weeks of my internship, I understood how a project should be developed and what needs to be done before it starts. Additionally, I do think I would choose to continue on web development even though I had hard time at some points.
